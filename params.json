This file can be modified manually or via the settings menu.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the configuration file must be as follows:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   \"interface\": \"...\", // e.g. \"Wi-Fi\", can be chosen via the menu\r\n   \"settings\": [\r\n      {\r\n         \"name\": \"...\",      // (Required) e.g. \"Google\"\r\n         \"servers\": [ ... ]  // (Required) e.g. [ \"8.8.8.8\", \"8.8.4.4\" ],\r\n         \"load_cmd\": \"...\"   // (Optional) e.g. \"echo 'Hello, world!'\"\r\n      }\r\n   ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`name`: The name of the setting that will be shown in the menu.\r\n\r\n`servers`: A list of IP addresses of the DNS servers that should be used.\r\n\r\n`load_cmd`: (optional) A shell command that should be run when these DNS servers are loaded.\r\n\r\n### Changing DNS settings\r\nSimply choose the DNS setting you want to change to and hit _Load_. You will be prompted for your login password to change your network preferences. The default interface that the DNS settings will be changed for is \"Wi-Fi\". This can be changed from the menu or via the configuration file as documented above.\r\n\r\n### Support / Contributions\r\nIf you find any bugs or want to suggest an improvement, please submit an issue. All contributions welcome!\r\n\r\n_Tested on OS X El Capitan (10.11.5)_",
